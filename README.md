## Introduction

Text-to-SQL systems translate natural language questions into SQL queries, providing substantial value for non-expert users. While large language models (LLMs) show promising results for this task, they remain error-prone. Query ambiguity has been recognized as a major obstacle for LLM-based Text-to-SQL systems, leading to misinterpretation of user intent and inaccurate SQL generation.

**AmbiSQL** is an interactive system that automatically detects query ambiguities and guides users through intuitive multiple-choice questions to clarify their intent. It is built on a fine-grained ambiguity taxonomy for identifying ambiguities that affect database element mapping and LLM reasoning, then incorporates user feedback to rewrite ambiguous questions.

## ✨ Key Features

* **Automatic Ambiguity Detection:** Identifies and classifies ambiguous phrases in the user's query based on a systematic ambiguity taxonomy.
* **Interactive Clarification:** Generates intuitive multiple-choice questions to let the user clarify their exact intent.
* **Query Rewriting:** Incorporates user feedback to construct a new, unambiguous natural language query.
* **Improved SQL Accuracy:** Provides a clean, precise query to a downstream Text-to-SQL system, boosting the accuracy of the generated SQL.

## 🌐 Live Demo

We have a live demo available for participants to explore: **[➡️ Try the AmbiSQL Demo](http://www.ambisql.tech)**

## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run AmbiSQL on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

* [Conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html)
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (including npm)

### Data Preparation

The database file used for evaluation is a subset of the [BIRD benchmark](https://bird-bench.github.io/), which can be downloaded from the [data repository](https://bird-bench.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/minidev.zip). We expect the unzipped database file to be stored in the project root directory(eg. /MINIDEV/...).

### 1. Setup and Run the Backend (FastAPI Server)

The backend is a FastAPI server that handles all the logic for ambiguity detection, clarification, SQL generation, SQL execution, and grounded answer generation.

```shell
# Navigate to the server directory
cd server

# Create and activate the conda environment
conda create -n ambiSQL python=3.10 -y
conda activate ambiSQL

# Install all dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# run the FastAPI backend on localhost:8765
python ambisql/server_2.py
```

### 2. Setup and Run the Frontend (Chatbox)

The frontend is a web interface for interacting with AmbiSQL.

```shell
# Navigate to the chatbox directory
cd chatbox

# Install all dependencies
npm cache clean --force
npm install

# Start the development server for the frontend
npm run dev
```

Remember to fill in your own `OPENAI_API_KEY` and `MODELSCOPE_API_KEY` into the project.

## ⚙️ How It Works: An Example

</p>

The user interface is split into three main panels: User Input, Ambiguity Resolution, and SQL Generation.

1. **User Input Panel `①`:**
   A user enters an ambiguous query, such as *"How many drivers born after the Vietnam War have been ranked 2?"*. They can also select the database and SQL dialect. For quick exploration, users can also load predefined examples from our dataset.
2. **Ambiguity Resolution Panel `②`:**
   AmbiSQL detects ambiguities and presents clarification questions:

   * For **"the end of the Vietnam War,"** it asks the user to choose a specific date (e.g., end date, or just the year).
   * For **"ranked 2,"** it presents a choice of relevant database columns (e.g., `rank`, `position`, `positionOrder`), showing a data snippet for context.
     The user selects their desired options from dropdown menus. They can also add optional constraints, like specifying the driver's nationality.
3. **SQL Generation Panel `③`:**
   After clarification, AmbiSQL rewrites the query and sends it to the downstream Text-to-SQL model ([XiYan-SQL](https://xgenerationlab-xiyan-qwen-instruct.ms.show/?) in our example). This panel displays a side-by-side comparison:

   * **Without AmbiSQL:** The SQL generated from the original, ambiguous query is often incorrect.
   * **With AmbiSQL:** The SQL generated from the clarified query accurately reflects the user's intent.

The **`Compare`** button validates the generated SQL against the ground truth, demonstrating how ambiguity resolution leads to more accurate results.
